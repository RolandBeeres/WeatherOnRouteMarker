https://efficiensea2.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Deliverable-4.5-and-D4.10-Operational-METOC-and-Ice-Chart-Service.pdf

#### Route and RTZ
All references to "route" and "RTZ" is related to the "Route Sharing Format", which was developed during
"MONALISA" project (http://stmvalidation.eu/projects/) and can be found here: http://cirm.org/rtz/index.html.
In short, the RTZ is an XML document containing route information such waypoint coordinates, ETA, ETD, etc.
In this demonstration, the interesting RTZ bits reformatted into JSON and hardcoded. The intention here
was also to create awareness of the RTZ.

#### Plugins
OpenLayers - https://openlayers.org/ - base map - using openstreetmap
Turf - http://turfjs.org/ - very useful tool to math around with geostuff in OL

#### About the code
All code is as vanilla as possible to ensure that every part is easily understandable for developers. 
Please do not comment on crappy code, may I suggest accepting it as a charm instead.
